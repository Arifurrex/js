## I remember CSS Grid according to four groups of properties:

1. The explicit grid
2. Gaps
3. Aligning things
4. The implicit grid


## The explicit grid

Let's say you want to make a grid with 4 columns and 3 rows. You say this 4 columns and 3 rows out loud. It's explicit.

If you declare the number of rows and columns in your grid, the grid is explicit.

You can use two properties to make an explicit grid:

1. grid-template-columns
2. grid-template-rows
3. 


## Deploying your project

As mentioned above, there are a number of ways to host your project for free. We recommend using [Vercel](https://bit.ly/fem-vercel) as it's an amazing service and extremely simple to get set up with. If you'd like to use Vercel, here are some steps to follow to get started:

1. [Sign up to Vercel](https://bit.ly/fem-vercel-signup) and go through the onboarding flow, ensuring your GitHub account is connected by using their [Vercel for GitHub](https://vercel.com/docs/v2/git-integrations/vercel-for-github) integration.
2. Connect your project to Vercel from the ["Import project" page](https://vercel.com/import), using the "From Git Repository" button and selecting the project you want to deploy.
3. Once connected, every time you `git push`, Vercel will create a new [deployment](https://vercel.com/docs/v2/platform/deployments) and the deployment URL will be shown on your [Dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard). You will also receive an email for each deployment with the URL.
